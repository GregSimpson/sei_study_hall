# [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com): JavaScript Study Hall

This study hall is an opportunity for you to work on a project or set of exercises with a group of your peers, and with the support of one of our JavaScript experts.

## Instructions

If you already have a project or set of exercises you are currently working on, please continue your work. If you do not have a project or set of exercises you are currently working on, we have a collection of exercises you can choose from below. You will have the support of our instructor and your peers throughout the study hall if you get stuck.

Each set of exercises is accompanied by a slide deck that may be a helpful learning resource and reference. If you would like direct instruction on these topics, you can attend the workshops corresponding to each slide deck in the future!
